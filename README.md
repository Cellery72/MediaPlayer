MediaPlayer
===========

Basic android media player, small side project. Will add more functionality.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Where do I want this project to go? 

- Eventually I'd like this to be a full media player including music, movies and books (pdfs/epubs). 
Each tab will house one type of media, the music tab will have 4 options to view songs (Songs, Albums, Artists, Playlists)

- I'd like add an 'On-The-Go' style playlist feature where the user can double tap a song it will be added to the que.
This means when listening to a song a user can double tap any other song to add it to the que and have it create a playlist "on the fly"

- The user will also be able to make real playlists too, this means they can create a playlist that will be saved, where as the on the go playlist will only be saved until the list is played
